## Recommendations

  16. If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

  17. Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
  - **This is a very simple and easy to understand product which I believe will improve their client acquisition as people prefer to adopt something that is simple and easy to use.** 
  18. What technologies would this additional product or service utilise?
  - **It would utilise the same technologies as what they currently offer, in addition to tap and go payment systems, it's easy accessibility will entice more people to sign up with ZIP.**
  19. Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
  - **Tap and go payment system is an appropriate solution since it allows customers to use their technology any time and anywhere with ease. When it comes to technology, people prefer simple because not everyone understands how to use it and by making the process more complicated, it can deter alot of customers.**
